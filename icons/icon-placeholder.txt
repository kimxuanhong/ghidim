To enable full PWA functionality, please create two icon files in this directory:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can use any card game related icon or logo. These icons will be displayed on the home screen when the app is installed.

Alternatively, you can use online icon generators to create these icons from your logo or app name.

These icon files are referenced in the manifest.json file and are required for PWA installation.
